It leads to descriptions of the dynamics in terms of amplitude-dependent natural frequency, daming factor, and mode-shapes for each mode. The Extended Periodic Motion Concept is a very popular methodology for capturing these numerically. The idea here is simple - it iteratively looks for what would be a linear self excitation (in terms of a negative viscous factor) that must be supplied to a system so that it has a periodic solution as an invariant set in its unforced state.Mathematically the system we will be solving is:mxM ddotvcu + mxC dotvcu + mxK vcu + vcf_nl = xi mxM dotvcuwhere xi controls the strength of the self-excitation. Since the system is always solved by the trivial solution, an amplitude constraint is often imposed. In order to simplify calculations later on, the first harmonic amplitude of the degrees of freedom is constrained as:vcU_c1^T mxM vcU_c1 + vcU_s1^T mxM vcU_s1 = a^2where vcU_c1 = fracOmegapi int_0^2piOmega vcu cosOmega t dt and vcU_s1 = fracOmegapi int_0^2piOmega vcu sinOmega t dt. (a) is the user-specified amplitude, which serves as the continuation parameter in this context. In addition to this, there is still a phase indeterminacy present in the system. So we choose an arbitrary DoF (which is expected to be non-zero in the mode under consideration), and set its cosine harmonic to be zero (other constraints are also possible). With this, we will have a square system (same number of unknowns as equations) and it can be solved to obtain the amplitude-dependent nonlinear modal characteristics of the system.","category":"page"},{"location":"c4_mdofgen_epmc/","page":"4: Nonlinear Normal Modes of a 2DoF Hysteretic Oscillator using EPMC","title":"4: Nonlinear Normal Modes of a 2DoF Hysteretic Oscillator using EPMC","text":"The EPMCRESFUN! routine in MDOFUTILS implements the residue function for EPMC that can be used in tandem with CONTINUATION to obtain nonlinear modal characteristics.
